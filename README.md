# sampleProjectforPIC

Hello Everyone! Today I'm going to introduce my simple PIC project.
The project has made a project to control a baby unit by using PIC microcontroller with some sensors and integrated circuits. You can follow the describition below to run this project on your PC.

Information About The Project
1) I have used Proteus v8.15. You have to use that version or upper version.
2) Gas Sensor has a hex file that is able to use Gas Sensor in folder. You must choose that hex file in schematicDesign.pdsprj.
3) Like index 2, you must select main.hex file to run PIC microcontroller.
4) The hex codes have compiled in CCS C Compiler.

Additionally, you have to keep these C files to run sensors that contain sensorA.C or sensorB.c.
Here are these: DS1302.C and dht-11.c
Open projects and change the command to run code.
